# Bitcoin Savings Circle Smart Contract

A decentralized smart contract for group Bitcoin savings with gamification features, designed for Bitcoin L2 solutions like Stacks or compatible rollups like Citrea.

## üéØ Overview

This smart contract enables communities to create savings circles where members contribute Bitcoin regularly and receive payouts in rotation. It includes gamification elements like streaks, badges, and leaderboards to encourage consistent participation.

- **JoinCircle()** - Join existing public circles or private circles by invitation
- **SubmitContribution()** - Make regular contributions to your circles
- **DistributePayout()** - Automated payout distribution to members in rotation
- **GetCircleStatus()** - Comprehensive circle information and member details

### Gamification Features
- **Streak Tracking** - Monitor consecutive contribution rounds
- **Badge System** - Earn badges for consistency and longevity
- **Leaderboard** - Compete with other members based on contributions and streaks
- **Achievement Levels** - NEWCOMER ‚Üí CONSISTENT ‚Üí VETERAN ‚Üí CHAMPION ‚Üí LEGEND

### Admin Functions
- **Member Management** - Circle owners can remove inactive members
- **Emergency Withdrawal** - Quorum-based emergency fund withdrawal

## üèó Architecture

### Smart Contract Structure

```solidity
contract BitcoinSavingsCircle {
    // Core data structures
    struct Circle {
        uint256 id;
        string name;
        address owner;
        uint256 contributionAmount;
        Frequency frequency;
        uint256 memberLimit;
        uint256 currentRound;
        uint256 payoutIndex;
        Visibility visibility;
        uint256 totalBTCSaved;
        uint256 createdAt;
        bool isActive;
    }

    struct Member {
        address addr;
        uint256 joinedAt;
        uint256 totalContributed;
        uint256 currentStreak;
        uint256 longestStreak;
        uint256 lastContributionRound;
        bool isActive;
        Badge[] badges;
    }
}
```

## üìã Usage Examples

### Creating a Circle

```javascript
// Create a weekly savings circle with 5 members
const circleId = await bitcoinSavingsCircle.createCircle(
    "Weekly Bitcoin Savers",
    ethers.utils.parseEther("0.001"), // 0.001 BTC per contribution
    0, // WEEKLY frequency
    5, // 5 members max
    0, // PUBLIC visibility
    { value: ethers.utils.parseEther("0.001") }
);
```

### Joining a Circle

```javascript
// Join an existing circle
await bitcoinSavingsCircle.joinCircle(
    circleId,
    { value: ethers.utils.parseEther("0.001") }
);
```

### Making Contributions

```javascript
// Submit contribution for current round
await bitcoinSavingsCircle.submitContribution(
    circleId,
    { value: ethers.utils.parseEther("0.001") }
);
```

### Distributing Payouts

```javascript
// Distribute payout to next member in rotation
await bitcoinSavingsCircle.distributePayout(circleId);
```

## üéÆ Gamification System

### Badge Levels
- **NEWCOMER** - Awarded when joining a circle
- **CONSISTENT** - 5+ consecutive contributions
- **VETERAN** - 10+ consecutive contributions
- **CHAMPION** - 20+ consecutive contributions
- **LEGEND** - 50+ consecutive contributions

### Leaderboard Scoring
```
Score = Total BTC Contributed + (Streak Count √ó 1000 wei)
```

## üîí Security Features

- **Reentrancy Protection** - Prevents reentrancy attacks
- **Access Control** - Circle owner permissions
- **Input Validation** - Comprehensive parameter validation
- **Emergency Withdrawal** - Quorum-based emergency procedures

## üìä Events for Frontend Integration

The contract emits events for easy frontend integration:

```solidity
event CircleCreated(uint256 indexed circleId, string name, address indexed owner, uint256 contributionAmount);
event MemberJoined(uint256 indexed circleId, address indexed member);
event ContributionMade(uint256 indexed circleId, address indexed member, uint256 amount, uint256 round);
event PayoutSent(uint256 indexed circleId, address indexed recipient, uint256 amount, uint256 round);
event BadgeAwarded(uint256 indexed circleId, address indexed member, Badge badge);
```
